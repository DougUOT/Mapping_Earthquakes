# Mapping_Earthquakes
An interactive map of Earthquakes; Use JavaScript's Leaflet library along with the Mapbox API to create visualizations of earthquake data form the U.S. Geological Survey

## Overview of Project

This module will expand on our JavaScript abilities and the D3 library to make an intuitive world guide. We will utilize GeoJSON; a JSON record explicitly intended to have geological data. We will explore geographical features such as points, which contain addresses and locations, like latitude and longitude coordinates. Linestrings contain facilitates for the limits of
 roads, interstates, travel courses, and structural plates. Furthermore, polygons which contain facilitate the limits of postal divisions, regions, nations, regions, and plots of land. We will likewise investigate non-spatial traits which are information free of all mathematical contemplations and bundled in the progressive design of a GeoJSON record. Utilizing our insight into JavaScript and the D3 library, we will cross and recover GeoJSON seismic tremor information and structural plate information to populate a geological guide. For this, we will likewise utilize the handout library and the Mapbox API. We should begin utilizing information from a GeoJSON record to populate a geological guide utilizing JavaScript and the D3 and pamphlet libraries

This assignment is related to the Bootcamp Data Analytics from the University of Toronto. It comprises the goals below for this module:: 

Follow below the goals for this module:

1) Objective 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
2) Objective 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
3) Objective 3: Add an Additional Map

## Results & Code




## Summary

Also We deployed a sample project to GitHub Pages available on https://douguot.github.io/DougUOT.githib.io-Mapping_Earthquake_Diploy/ in order to share our live projects with colleagues, potential employers and the wider community of programmers as well.
